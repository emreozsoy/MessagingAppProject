## Acknowledgment
I would like to express my gratitude to my esteemed instructor and advisor, Prof. Dr. Cihan KARAKUZU, for their guidance and unwavering support throughout the entire preparation of this project, from start to finish.

## Project Objective

The aim of the project is to create a game application that can be used on mobile devices
and provides interactive communication with the user based on visuals and stories.
## Scope of Project

Within the scope of the project, in order to develop an application supported by cross mo-
bile platforms over Android Studio, it was designed visually via Figma and implemented
in Flutter.

## Results

This application is able to run on mobile devices with Android/IOS operating systems
and interactively communicates with the user to effectively deliver the story. The story is
presented with the support of text and visual elements, which can also spark interest in a
wider audience. As a result, it offers a different experience for the user in terms of mobile
gaming.
